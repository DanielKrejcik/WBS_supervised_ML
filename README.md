supervised Machine Learning | Categorisation | Regression

This repository showcase the first steps in supervised machine learning using the housing dataset found on kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marcopale/housing

As the names suggest one each focuses on categorisation, determining whether a house is expensive or not. The second notebook gives a solution to the regression problem, thus predicting the actual price of those houses.

The categorisation notebook showcases the utilization of random tree and random forest classifiers as well as finetuning those via cross-validation.
The regression notebook shows the application of random forest-, gradient boosting- and SGD-regressors as well as voting regression of the aforementioned algorithms. Again, cross-validation is used to tweak the model.
